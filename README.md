# serviceGenerateLogs
This is a simple test service (start.sh, stop.sh) that generates logs and archives them. 
This service can be used for testing. You can also add it to the crontab.

service_v2.sh is already an updated version, 
you run this script and logs and archives will be generated until you stop it.
